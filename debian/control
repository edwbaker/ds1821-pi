Description: DS1821 1-Wire thermometer/thermostat tools for Raspberry Pi
 Command-line tools for reading temperature and programming thermostat
 thresholds on a DS1821 1-Wire sensor via direct GPIO bit-bang (pigpio).
 The DS1821 in thermostat mode is incompatible with the kernel w1 stack
 and must be the only device on its bus.
 .
 Includes:
  - ds1821: read temperature, set TH/TL thresholds, scan bus, probe status
  - ds1821-update: wrapper that writes readings to /run/ds1821/
  - systemd timer (disabled by default, enable with systemctl)
